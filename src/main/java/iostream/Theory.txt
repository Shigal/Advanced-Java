- io handling involves taking input from some external source
- it can be from cmd, a file or an another consumer application, or from a hard disk

- we have an input source and we have an output destination and the way the input source
sends data to the destination is via streams

- basically it converts the data into zeroes and ones, those 1's and 0's travels as a stream

- whenever we read data we call input stream

- whenever we are writing something we call output stream

- whenever we are reading data from a datasource or writing data to a datasource
that data can either be simple character string (English characters or UNICODE character) or
a tabular data in a database or xml file or html or anything
- that's why java has 2 different ways

- (1) deal with file containing characters we can use character stream
- (2) if we don't know what kind of data the file contains then use Byte stream

- character stream internally uses byte stream

- character stream is more simpler and faster

- if we use character stream that the file will be read character by character

- if we use byte stream file will be read byte by byte
