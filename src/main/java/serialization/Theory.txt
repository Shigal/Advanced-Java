- we may come across a situation where we want to send information from one application to another application
in different machine

- think of it like a network of computers where we have a producer application and a consumer application

- producer application produces the object and it is travelled over a network line and reaches the consumer application
so, how does the consumer application receives the object and how does the producer application sends the object

- when the data travels over the network line it is all bytes
but how do we convert a java object into bytes and send it over network and the consumer application again converts the
bytes into object to use that inside its application

- The process of converting an object into byte so that it can be sent over a network is called serialization

- The process of converting back the byte into an object is called deserialization

- to use this we have Serializable interface in Java

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- what if we don't want to allow some properties to be seen by the consumer application
 and we don't want to serialize it

 - there comes transient keyword
 if we put it in front of a member variable, we don't want this variable to be serialized or deserialized
