- To connect to a database we need to have the address of the database
 That is what we call the connection url

- 5432 is the port on which postgresql server runs

- to connect Java program to a database, we need to use java.sql.Connection class

- java is a programming language which doesn't come with its own database
but we have number of database vendors - mysql, postgresql, microsoft sql, oracle etc
so, java wants to find out a unique way to connect to all databases.

- java got this interface called jdbc, said whoever wants to make connections to db should follow these specifications

- Hence, JDBC provides the interface with the methods declarations. And the databases(oracle, mysql, etc)
are supposed to implement that interface and provide their own implementations

-whoever wants to connect to java has to create a driver, that driver contains the implementations of JDBC.
That's why we downloaded the postgresql driver jar file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we are going to create a table in postgresql GUI within the database test
 test -> schemas -> public -> Tables -> create it . .

- database connection is one of the costly connection in java programming
so never forget to close the connection otherwise it will face serious db bottleneck

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- adding the driver
 file -> project structure -> modules -> dependencies -> select the .jar

this is how we add this in build class path
 by this way we don't really have to add this in the dependency of the pom file
