NIO - Non-blocking Input Output

- as we already have IO package in java why we need nio
the reason is nio provides the multithreading capability to IO

- basically we don't want to block the thread while it reads a file or writes to a file

- Normally the thread gets locked when we are reading a file or writing to a file until
the it done writing or reading
and nio provides an improvement over that

- when we read a file it happens from the channel into the buffer

- when we write to a file it happens from the buffer to the channel

- whenever we want to read, we will have to first open a channel, create a buffer
and then we can read from the channel into the buffer

- buffer is a container for the data
- channel is kind of pipeline / connection
