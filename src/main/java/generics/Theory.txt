- java is a strong type checking language at compile type because every object is of a particular type
- it checks the types of the variables, classes at the compile time

- inspiration for generics comes from the idea of reusing the same code with different inputs

- when it is about generic think of it as we need to develop of login functionality for the user and
the consumer application, here we are going to have the same kind of functionality. So, instead
 of repeating the code we can reuse the code twice

- Collection framework is built upon the concept of generics
